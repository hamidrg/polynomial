# Polynomials
* In this project, the polynomial class has been implemented, which supports most mathematical operations

## Implemented mathematical operations in this project:
*  Operator +
* Operator -
* Operator *
* Operator +=
* Operator -=
*  Operator *=
* Operator =
* Operator >, <, <=, >=, ==, !=
* Operator ~
* Operator ++ (Post / Pre-increment)
* Operator -- (Post / Pre-decrement)
* Operator ()
* Operator [] (index operator for vector)
* Operator << (overload ostream)
* Operator >> (overload istream)
